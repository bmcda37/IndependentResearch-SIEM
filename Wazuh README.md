# Wazuh Cluster

## Purpose
For this project, I will be using Wazuh as my SIEM tool. Wazuh provides a general installation guide at ``` ```; however, you will need to make changes to the configuration files which will be discussed in this README. The completed config files showing my specific configurations will be attached in the single-node folder within this repository.

## Config for Vulnerabilities
```
<vulnerability-detector>
    <enabled>yes</enabled>
    <interval>5m</interval>
    <min_full_scan_interval>6h</min_full_scan_interval>
    <run_on_start>yes</run_on_start>

# Wazuh Components

## Wazuh Manager

The Wazuh manager analyzes the data received from the agents. For processing the agent data, it uses decoders and rules while also incorporating threat intelligence. The Wazuh manager is also used to manage the agents, configuring and upgrading them remotely when necessary.

## Wazuh Indexer

 The Wazuh Indexer is a full-text search and analytics engine. This central component indexes and stores alerts generated by the Wazuh server.

## Wazuh Dashboard

The Wazuh Dashboard is the web user interface for data visualization and analysis. It includes out-of-the-box dashboards for security events, regulatory compliance (e.g., PCI DSS, GDPR, CIS, HIPAA, NIST 800-53), detected vulnerable applications, file integrity monitoring data, configuration assessment results, cloud infrastructure monitoring events, and others. It is also used to manage Wazuh configuration and to monitor its status.
