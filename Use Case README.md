# Use Case 1
## Remote Agent Monitoring & Vulnerability Resolution

For my first use case, I will be demonstrating the results showcasing the completion of configuring Wazuh to remotely monitor my Wazuh-Agents which was installed on my Ubuntu VM. I will also show how I resolved a "level 5 (critical)" vulnerability on this VM.

## Part 1: Installing Wazuh-Agent on Ubuntu 20.04 VM
To complete the installation of my Wazuh-Agent, I followed the instructions found in my "WazuhREADME.md". Once finishing the installation, I restarted the agent which allowed me to log in to my Wazuh-Dashboard showing the successful completion of enrolling my agent.
