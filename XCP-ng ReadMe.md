# XCP-ng 

To host my VMs in this project, I will be using the Xen hypervisor allowing me to host VMs on my XCP-ng server.

When beginning the installation, I first needed to download the ISO file for xcp-ng, creating a bootable USB stick.

I then used the bootable USB drive to start the host and completed the BIOS install.

For the networking portion of the installation guide, I will be using DHCP.

Now we will begin adding VMs to my server.

- Create a shareable file on my system to ensure the xcp-ng server can retrieve any iso files on my host. 
- Use your IP address of the host machine followed by the path to the shareable folder where your iso files are located.
    - Use cmd ipconfig to find the IP address of the host machine.
