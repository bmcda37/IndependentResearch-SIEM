# My Independent Research using SIEM technologies and integrations
For my home SIEM lab, I decided to go with Wazuh. I am using the single-node option since I do not need more.
I will now walk you through the process I followed for setting this up. Enjoy!

The following are the different systems used throughout my project:
-Docker: Using Docker Compose to host my Wazuh Stack.
-Wazuh Stack: Single-Node configuration consisting of Wazuh Manager, Wazuh Indexer, & Wazuh Dashboard.
-XCP-ng: Server hosting VMs
-VMs: Kali Linux, Parrot
