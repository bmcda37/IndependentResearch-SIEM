# My Independent Research using SIEM technologies and integrations
For my home SIEM lab, I decided to go with Wazuh. I am using the single-node option since I do not need more.

# The following are the different systems used throughout my project:
*-Docker: Using Docker Compose to host my Wazuh Stack.
*-Wazuh Stack: Single-Node configuration consisting of Wazuh Manager, Wazuh Indexer, & Wazuh Dashboard.
*-XCP-ng: Server hosting VMs
*-VMs: Kali Linux, Parrot
