# My Independent Research using SIEM technologies and integrations
For this self-led project, I decided to configure a home SIEM lab using Wazuh. I am using the single-node option since I do not need more worker nodes for the volume of agents I will be installing. I implemented various technologies that I learned from my undergraduate, internships, and research to formulate a complete solution, allowing the completion of Use Case scenarios.

## Core competencies within the project:
- Linux File System
- scp, ssh
- Docker/Docker Compose configuration, Portaniner 
- Networking Concepts: Subnetting, Port Forwarding, Virtualization Management
- Zero Trust Network Architecture
- GitHub, GitHub Projects, Python, Bash, VScode, WSL

## Technologies used within the project:
- Docker: Using Docker Compose to host my Wazuh Stack
- Wazuh Stack: Single-Node configuration consisting of Wazuh Manager, Wazuh Indexer, & Wazuh Dashboard
- XCP-ng: Server hosting VMs
- Virtual Machines: Kali Linux, Parrot
- Twingate (ZTNA Solution) for remote access
- Caldera- Threat simulation
